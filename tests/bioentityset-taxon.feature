Feature: homologous set of bioentities returned for a given gene all have a valid taxon

 Scenario Outline: User fetches all homologs for a human gene and they all have their taxon info
    Given a path "/bioentity/gene/<hgncID>/homologs/?homology_type=O&fetch_objects=false&rows=200"
    when the content is converted to JSON
      then the JSON should have some JSONPath "associations[*].object.taxon.id" of type "string"
      and the JSON should have some JSONPath "associations[*].object.taxon.label" of type "string"
    Examples: human genes
